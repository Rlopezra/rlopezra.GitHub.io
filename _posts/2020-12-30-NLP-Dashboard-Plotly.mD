I created a dashboard analysing the [Kaggle 515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe) dataset 
using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dashboard was created using Plotly and is being hosted by PythonAnywhere.

[You can view the dashboard by following this link](http://rlopezra.pythonanywhere.com/)

The dashboard has two components, the first compares the most frequently used and most important bigrams between two nationalities. The second component visualizes a Word2Vec word embedding in two dimensions using t-SNE.

## What I Learned
This project started with the goal of familiarizing myself with Plotlyâ€™s Dash platform and being comfortable creating a complex dashboard with multiple callbacks. Even though that goal was met, what I got the most from this project was the knowledge of how to host the dashboard.

It was pretty easy and straightforward to build the dashboard due to great [documentation]( https://dash.plotly.com/) and the numerous public [apps]( https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/) whose code is available. Any proficient Python programmer could build a comparable dashboard in less than a day.
