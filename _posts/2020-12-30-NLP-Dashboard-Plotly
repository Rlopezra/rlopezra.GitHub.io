I created a dashboard analysing the [Kaggle 515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe) dataset 
using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dashboard was created using Plotly and is being hosted by a server on PythonAnywhere.

[You can view the dashboard by following this link](http://rlopezra.pythonanywhere.com/)
